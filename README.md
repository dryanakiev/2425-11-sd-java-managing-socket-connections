# Simple Socket Client-Server in Java

This repository contains a basic example of a socket-based client-server application in Java. The application demonstrates communication between a server and a client using TCP sockets. 

**Note:** This repository is for educational purposes only. It provides a simple implementation of socket programming in Java and is not intended for production use.

## Features

- **Server**:
  - Listens on a specific IP address and port for incoming client connections.
  - Sends a welcome message to the client.
  - Reads and displays messages sent by the client.
  
- **Client**:
